`` creating conflict ``

## In this scenario, git pull will download all the changes from the point where the local and main diverged. In this example, that point is E. git pull will fetch the diverged remote commits which are A-B-C. The pull process will then create a new local merge commit containing the content of the new diverged remote commits.
